			<div class = "info"> The data came from <i> https://bikeshare.metro.net/about/data/ </i>. We used data on Downtown LA Bike trips provided by this source,
				and given to us by Capital One. The data we had wasn't super useful to learn about specific location names (it just had Station IDs), so we added all the actual
				locations for each Station ID. We used this dataframe in Jupyter Notebook for all our visualizations and calculations. The data was mostly complete, and was extensive
				enough to make meaningful conclusions about Bike Trips in Downtown LA. Below are the variables we had access to.
