			<div class = "info"> Here are three metrics visualized.
				The first metric was which stations were most popular, by the amount of trips starting from that station.
				Though we explored this below, this graphic helps to visualize the popularity based on the size of the circle.
				The second metric was Average Trip duration for each Passholder Type. Its evident that the walk up and staff annual passholders take much longer trips than the more regular riders.
				The third metric was the number locations of the bike with the most trips : Bike 4727 with 312 trips. We visualized these locations on a map - and discovered Bike 4727 has been to 81.82 percent of LA Stations!
